  <h1>Text Typefaces</h1>

  <p>Traditionally, text is composed to create a readable, coherent, and visually
    satisfying typeface that works invisibly, without the awareness of the reader.
    Even distribution of typeset material, with a minimum of distractions and anomalies,
    is aimed at producing clarity and transparency.</p>

  <h2>Color</h2>

  <p>In typesetting, color is the overall density of the ink on the page, determined mainly by the typeface, but also by the word spacing, leading, and depth of the margins. Text layout, tone, or color of the set text, and the interplay of text with
    the white space of the page in combination with other graphic elements impart a "feel" or "resonance" to the subject matter.</p>
  <h2>Principles of the Typographic Craft</h2>

  <p>Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable" are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but related concepts. Legibility and
    readability tend to support aesthetic aspects of a product.</p>
